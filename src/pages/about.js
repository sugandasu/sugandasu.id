          The first time I know/Learn about programming was when I was studying
          Informatic Engineering at Tadulako University. It's been few years
          since I graduated, but even now I am still studying about programming.

          I'm good with PHP, Python and Javascript, and want to learn about
          everyting that I can get, since I love learning. Thats is why I
          created this blog, it is mostly to record my journey as a Software
          Engineer.
